# node-twitter-app
A Node.js based Twitter bot.

The bot queries the Unsplash API for a random image, saves it to disk, then uploads and posts it to Twitter via the Twit package.
Triggered with ```setInterval()``` once an hour. 

It can be easily repurposed to tweet something different, or to add extra functionality such as retweeting.
